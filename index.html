						<h2 class="">About Me</h2>
							<hr>
							<img class="pull-left" src="assets/images/profilePhoto.jpg" alt="image-placeholder" width="200px" height="200px">
							<p class="">Technical and business-savvy full-stack developer with a focus on the MERN stack and JavaScript. Continuously on a relentless hunt to create positive change by fostering cross-functional cooperation and leveraging best practices. I am passionate about new technologies and new skills; I plan to utilize that passion to fully dedicate my life to do what I love: bridging technology and people to conceive and construct great things.</p>
							<br>
							<p>My exposure with working for a full-service marketing agency and for one of Los Angeles’s premiere Nightlife & Entertainment groups for over five years introduced me to multiple verticals, including entertainment, hospitality, high-end retail, aviation, and eCommerce. My management experience has taught me that the key to success is augmenting the value of both technology and people to deliver new solutions, revenues, and efficiencies. I specialize in programmatic yield optimization, SEO, eCommerce, direct response, marketing automation, and email marketing, through which I was introduced to the world of web application development.</p>
							<br>
							<p>My goal is to work full-time as a web developer in an environment where I can advocate for the customer, nurture clear communication channels and strengthen relationships between the customer, technology, and other teams. In addition to the hands-on, technical skills that I acquired in my previous roles, my background also gives me a robust understanding of clients’ wants, which will be very helpful for any company producing web applications on behalf of clients. Above all, I am eager to grow my knowledge of how the technology industry works, contribute to the community, and work on the cutting edge of technology.
